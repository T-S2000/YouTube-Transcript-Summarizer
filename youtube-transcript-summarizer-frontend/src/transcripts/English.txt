So when you reach out to them ask them if they have scholarships and they will step you through that process for how to apply for that there's also other scholarships available and i would say to really talk with your education usa office and learn more about some other scholarships that might be available that's a very good point that there is education to say all around the world you have locally you you have local experts who can talk to you about the academy. You we're grateful to have you it is now time for us to answer questions from our friends on questions from our friends on facebook many viewers are asking about scholarships how do students apply for scholarships to the education usa academy jackie can i ask you about that. But now i know how to do college assignments better and everything that's fantastic well congratulations on your english as well because you did you've done a great job That no that's really thank you very much our next book thank you very much our next question is from ascend katawa who would like from ascend katawa who would like you a sin katawa who would like to know what are the different requirements for a student to apply to the academy sally can i ask you that sure you and so again the age and the program is the academy is for 15 is the academy is for 15 to 18 year olds and high school students so those are to still be in high school and to be in that age and then the english level requirement that actually varies a little bit from from academy to academy and again each of the academies it specifies what their requirements are for the english language requirements and there aren't there may be a few other specific you aren't there maybe a few other specific requirements from specific academies but it's a excitement in a desire to explore and don'ts do a little bit of a desire to be a little bit independent so this program unlike some other programs is not one where you come with a group for the most part you're coming on your own so that sense of adventure that you will be well taken care of but it is a little bit of an adventure is is maybe helpful that's fantastic and that definitely links is maybe helpful that's fantastic and that definitely links to where jackie was saying that you need to students need to look at each of the academy you the students need to look at each of the academy programs and see what they offer because they can be a little bit different right.
