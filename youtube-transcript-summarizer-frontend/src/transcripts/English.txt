And i got this so a lot of universities let's say 95% of them will require you to at least have a transcript with six semesters worth of grades and this is one more university each let's say sjsu it requires used to transcript with minimum seven semester grades so that's the case that most thing that will happen and if you've already graduated you can have a eight semester transcript well then so how do you deal with these transcripts first things first keep other transcripts safe he'll take one out open the envelope and go to the oneidas a talk show up and a few harvest and at home just get it scanned and high-quality and store it in pdf format some universities want you to upload the soft copy of your transcripts on the websites which most of the universities will ask you to do and some of them want physical copy of the transcript mailed to them directly like this in this format the signal should not be tampered remember keep your other transcripts safely and only open one of them alright. And also if you want to go for double use evaluation they will also need your transcripts to evaluate your grades all day so this is what you need your transcripts for to show the universities that these are your grades and how well you've done in your exam so that they can evaluate your sofa how many transcripts you should order let's take my example i ordered ten transcripts which costed me around three thousand and three thousand one hundred rupees which was a lot of money for nothing because i only used four of them here six of my transcripts which actually absolutely got wasted now i'm pretty sure that you have a list of universities that you want to apply to. So why don't you go over there and check the document requirements if they need a transcript then only you order a transcript for that to niversity why to waste money on something that you will not need later right so let's say you keep a track of the universities they're asking for transcript that's the three of the universities asking for the physical copy of transcripts or that see transcripts plus one to get it scanned. Hey peeps how's it going so this video is going to be about transcripts and i will explain you everything in detail so this is what our transcript looks like this is my college's official transcript so this is the fun side it's an envelope in which the draw your transcript is going to be kept this is the official sealed part remember whatever happens do not tamper with it this is how you let the university is know that it has directly come from college. So and there's also one thing that you will notice there's only six semesters over the earth one two three four five six And uploaded for universities website for the other cities which are asking for the soft copy that is for that so you want to go for double use evaluation you can order phi and just keep one extra on for the safety side so you can order that on six so you can take you make your own calculations and it totally depends on you are they now how do you send these transcripts to universities because i just said that it is required you to send your physical copy of the transcripts to them how do you send them so first off when i was starting out i sent my transcript to iceland austria to the worse city using dhl service and it costed me around 2200 two peas which was around $3000 and i would consider that expensive they also went to check at fedex and they were asking for the charge of three thousand and then when they ask them ask them the reason they told that even though the transcripts are really really right let's say only twenty thirty or forty grams but still they qualify for a five hundred gram order so find it go glam orders like these houses and fedex in two thousand two hundred and again so it costs pretty high. And he just took it with him and it got delivered within three to four days and even dhl fedex would take on the two to two to three days in the end it's your decision you can go ahead with whatever service you want digital fedex yo get your wish totally so this was a short brief summary of what transcripts are and how you should send them to universities and how the universities help you to a value to profile. No i'm not promoting them it's just that they sent my transcript for like only thousand bucks which is like half the price of dhl that's why i thought i would recommend that to you guys if you are from india you can go ahead with your cat service and send transcript service.
